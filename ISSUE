1. "PROP" or "LOCAL" only in assertions
2. localize and unlocalize
3. auto unfold listrep
4. R/W for listrep's head
5. Examples for wand-frame
6. multi-break in loops
7. Make annotated programs' structure consistent with verification structure: break with no post-loop condition and if with one branch break/continue/return
8. forward_call
9. offset_val v.s. field_address
10. A tactic lib "repeat forwardD" to gather all entailments together.
11. strange verification flow in loop bodies. This might be solved by 10.
12. A ad-hoc solver for listrep and/or lseg_rec.

2022.10.25: unreachable paths cause failure of proof goal generation (missing return, ...)
            e.g. while (1) { ... } /* unreachable */
            [fixed: simple conditions will be simplified like clightgen, for while/if]
2022.10.25: normal exit should be valid in void function
    [ fixed: Also consider "post_normal" and "atom_normal" when
      generating proof goals for void functions ]
