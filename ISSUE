1. "PROP" or "LOCAL" only in assertions
2. localize and unlocalize
3. auto unfold listrep
4. R/W for listrep's head
5. Examples for wand-frame
6. multi-break in loops
7. Make annotated programs' structure consistent with verification structure: break with no post-loop condition and if with one branch break/continue/return
8. forward_call
9. offset_val v.s. field_address
10. A tactic lib "repeat forwardD" to gather all entailments together.
11. strange verification flow in loop bodies. This might be solved by 10.
12. A ad-hoc solver for listrep and/or lseg_rec.
